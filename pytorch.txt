Installation
Create a conda environment and install required packages:
conda create -n <env> python=3.6
conda activate <env>
pip install -r requirements.txt
Clone this repo:
mkdir ACL
cd ACL
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/Adversarial-Continual-Learning.git
The following structure is expected in the main directory:
./src                     : main directory where all scripts are placed in
./data                    : data directory
./src/checkpoints         : results are saved in here
For each datasest run the following commands from src directory. Config file for each experiment contains the hyperparameters we used in the paper:
Split MNIST (5 Tasks):

python main.py --config ./configs/config_mnist5.yml

Permuted MNIST (10 Tasks):

python main.py --config ./configs/config_pmnist.yml

Split CIFAR100 (20 Tasks):

python main.py --config ./configs/config_cifar100.yml

Split MiniImageNet (20 Tasks):

python main.py --config ./configs/config_miniimagenet.yml

Sequence of 5 Tasks (CIFAR10, MNIST, notMNIST, Fashion MNIST, SVHN)

python main.py --config ./configs/config_multidatasets.yml

ACL with ResNet18 backbone
See here.

Datasets
miniImageNet data should be downloaded and pickled as a dictionary (data.pkl) with images and labels keys and placed in a sub-folder in ags.data_dir named as miniimagenet. The script used to split data.pkl into training and test sets is included in data dorectory (data/)

notMNIST dataset is included here in ./data/notMNIST as it was used in our experiments.

Other datasets will be automatically downloaded and extracted to ./data if they do not exist.
