Fields
kind	
string

[Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#project for projects.

id	
string (fixed64 format)

[Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. This is not the project ID, and is just a unique ID used by Compute Engine to identify resources.

creationTimestamp	
string

[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

name	
string

The project ID. For example: my-example-project. Use the project ID to make requests to Compute Engine.

description	
string

An optional textual description of the resource.

commonInstanceMetadata	
object

Metadata key/value pairs available to all instances contained in this project. See Custom metadata for more information.

commonInstanceMetadata.fingerprint	
string (bytes format)

Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata's contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.

To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve the resource.

A base64-encoded string.

commonInstanceMetadata.items[]	
object

Array of key/value pairs. The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.

commonInstanceMetadata.items[].key	
string

Key for the metadata entry. Keys must conform to the following regexp: [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+, and be less than 128 bytes in length. This is reflected as part of a URL in the metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other metadata keys for the project.

commonInstanceMetadata.items[].value	
string

Value for the metadata entry. These are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed on values is that their size must be less than or equal to 262144 bytes (256 KiB).

commonInstanceMetadata.kind	
string

[Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#metadata for metadata.

quotas[]	
object

[Output Only] Quotas assigned to this project.

quotas[].metric	
enum

[Output Only] Name of the quota metric.

quotas[].limit	
number

[Output Only] Quota limit for this metric.

quotas[].usage	
number

[Output Only] Current usage of this metric.

quotas[].owner	
string

[Output Only] Owning resource. This is the resource on which this quota is applied.

usageExportLocation	
object

The naming prefix for daily usage reports and the Google Cloud Storage bucket where they are stored.

usageExportLocation.bucketName	
string

The name of an existing bucket in Cloud Storage where the usage report object is stored. The Google Service Account is granted write access to this bucket. This can either be the bucket name by itself, such as example-bucket, or the bucket name with gs:// or https://storage.googleapis.com/ in front of it, such as gs://example-bucket.

usageExportLocation.reportNamePrefix	
string

An optional prefix for the name of the usage report object stored in bucketName. If not supplied, defaults to usage. The report is stored as a CSV file named report_name_prefix_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv where YYYYMMDD is the day of the usage according to Pacific Time. If you supply a prefix, it should conform to Cloud Storage object naming conventions.

enabledFeatures[]	
string

Restricted features enabled for use on this project.

selfLink	
string

[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

defaultServiceAccount	
string

[Output Only] Default service account used by VMs running in this project.

xpnProjectStatus	
enum

[Output Only] The role this project has in a shared VPC configuration. Currently, only projects with the host role, which is specified by the value HOST, are differentiated.

defaultNetworkTier	
enum

This signifies the default network tier used for configuring resources of the project and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD. Initially the default network tier is PREMIUM.

Authorization Scopes
Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
For more information, see the Authentication Overview.

IAM Permissions
In addition to any permissions specified on the fields above, authorization requires one or more of the following IAM permissions:

compute.projects.get
To find predefined roles that contain those permissions, see Compute Engine IAM Roles.

Examples
C#
Go
Java
Node.js
PHP
Python
Ruby
Uses the .NET client library.


// BEFORE RUNNING:
// ---------------
// 1. If not already done, enable the Compute Engine API
//    and check the quota for your project at
//    https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute
// 2. This sample uses Application Default Credentials for authentication.
//    If not already done, install the gcloud CLI from
//    https://cloud.google.com/sdk and run
//    `gcloud beta auth application-default login`.
//    For more information, see
//    https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials
// 3. Install the C# client library by adding a dependency on the relevant NuGet
//    package. Libraries published by Google are owned by google-apis-packages:
//    https://www.nuget.org/profiles/google-apis-packages
