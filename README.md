## üìö Tutorial

This repository contains the completed Xcode project following the [How to Build a Telemedicine App with Video and Chat for iOS](https://comingsoon/) tutorial. You should read it before trying to run this project as it contains it may contain useful information not present in this README.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

## Requirements

- A [Stream](https://getstream.io/accounts/signup/) account
- A [Dolby.io](https://dolby.io/organizations/register) account

### Configuration

You should place your [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat) and [Dolby.io](https://dolby.io) credentials in [`AppDelegate.swift`](TelemedicineApp/TelemedicineApp/AppDelegate.swift#L21-L23).

### Dependencies

To install the dependencies, use CocoaPods in the TelemedicineApp folder:

```bash
$ pod install --repo-update

Run this sample app as any normal app, but only on real devices. If you run in a simulator, the chat will work, but you won't be able to watch or stream video due to limitations of the simulator, though voice should work.
