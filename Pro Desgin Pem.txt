Abstract
In Project P5, we introduce Pro/ENGINEER design optimization capabilities as well as conducting interactive design using the suite of Pro/ENGINEER CAD/CAE/CAM capabilities for a multidisciplinary design problem. We include an optimization design study for a cantilever beam as a single-objective optimization of single engineering discipline, including only structural performance measures. Then we present a single-piston engine example to illustrate the interactive design process discussed in Chapter 3 involving multiple engineering disciplines. For those who are not familiar with Pro/ENGINEER and embedded CAE/CAM modules, we encourage you to go over Projects P1 to P4 of the book series before moving forward with this tutorial project. Without going over these prior projects, you may get lost very quickly. Example models of the current project are available for download at the book’s companion website.
